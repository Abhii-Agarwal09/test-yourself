# Test Yourself

Our application "Test Yourself" is a quiz generator designed with accessibility in mind. MCQ tests are widely used for education and recruitment purposes, but they can be difficult for users with color blindness. We believe that everyone should have access to knowledge and, therefore, have implemented features to make our quiz generator accessible for users with disabilities.
